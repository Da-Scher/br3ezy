## The Federated Streaming Service
---
breeezy, stylized br3ezy, is a GPL-2.0 licensed federated streaming platform that hosts can use to simplify distributed and/or self-hosted streaming to their audience. By self-hosted streaming, these hosts can take sovereignty over their own message without compromising for advertisers. This project will include a killer feature where subletters can sponsor a CDN in their region to propogate better streaming for other viewers, thereby becoming 'heros'. 
Tech stack nodejs for the backend and angularjs for the front end.
