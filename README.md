## The Federated Streaming Service
breeezy, stylized br3ezy, is a GPL-2.0 licensed federated streaming platform that hosts can use to simplify distributed and/or self-hosted streaming to their audience. By self-hosted streaming, these hosts can take sovereignty over their own message without compromising for advertisers. This project will include a killer feature where subletters can sponsor a CDN in their region to propogate better streaming for other viewers, thereby becoming 'heros'. 
Tech stack nodejs for the backend and angularjs for the front end.

### Main Contributors:
* Joe Barteluce is building a cool layout that attracts viewers, and is responsive to all viewports.
* Dakota Schaeffer is building a method to distribute the cost for reducing the latency caused by distance.
* Justin Sprecco is building the database API for the VOD component
